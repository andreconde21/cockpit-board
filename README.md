# Cockpit Board

A dynamic Kanban board for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) driven by frontmatter properties. Drag-and-drop updates files instantly. Includes calendar views, timers, recurring tasks, and a checklist editor.

## Features

- **Kanban Board** — Cards auto-sort into columns based on configurable rules (`status:`, `date:`, `label:`, `no-date`)
- **Drag & Drop** — Move cards between columns or reorder within. Bulk drag with multi-select (Ctrl+Click)
- **Calendar Views** — Week, month, and year views with time grid, all-day cards, and year heatmap
- **Timers** — Start/stop timers on cards, time tracked in `time_spent` frontmatter
- **Recurring Tasks** — Cron-based rules create tasks automatically each day
- **Checklist Editor** — Click the checklist count to open a drag-and-drop editor modal
- **Archive Search** — Search completed tasks in a YYYY/MM/DD folder structure
- **Auto-Archive** — Optionally move done cards into the archive folder after a configurable number of days
- **Due-Soon Notifications** — Configurable lead times (default 15 and 1 minutes before a task's time), with optional desktop notifications that reach you when Obsidian is in the background
- **Mobile Optimized** — Tab-based column switching with swipe gestures
- **Privacy Mode** — Blur card titles (hover to reveal) for screen sharing
- **Focus Mode** — Show only Today + In Progress columns (press `F`)
